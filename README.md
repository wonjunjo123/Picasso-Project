# Picasso

An application that allows the user to create expressions that
evaluate to colors and then eventually to images.

The given code base is a good start, but it is sparsely documented
(document each method/part after you understand what it's doing) and,
as your application grows, you may need to refactor.

See the specification for Picasso on the course web site.

## Running Picasso

To run Picasso, run `picasso.Main`

## Project Organization

`src` - the source code for the project

`conf` - the configuration files for the project

The `images` directory contains some sample images generated from Picasso.  Some of the expressions for these images can be found in the `expressions` directory.

## Code Base History

This code base originated as a project in a course at Duke University.  The professors realized that the code could be designed better and refactored.  This code base has some code leftover from the original version.
