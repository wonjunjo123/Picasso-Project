# Picasso  
## Barrett Bourgeois, Mark Holden, Wonjun Jo, Nick Lagges, Zachary Moore 

An application that allows the user to create expressions that
evaluate to colors and then eventually to images.

The given code base is a good start, but it is sparsely documented
(document each method/part after you understand what it's doing) and,
as your application grows, you may need to refactor.

See the specification for Picasso on the course web site.

## Running Picasso

To run Picasso, run `picasso.Main`

## Project Organization

`src` - the source code for the project

`conf` - the configuration files for the project

The `images` directory contains some sample images generated from Picasso.  Some of the expressions for these images can be found in the `expressions` directory.
## Extensions

### Allow user to see rgb values on canvas
This extension allows the user to click on the canvas to see the (r,g,b) values where their mouse is. 
The extension also allows the user to see the coordinates where they've clicked by showing their mouse position.
The coordinates and colors will be given in range [-1,1].

## Code Base History

This code base originated as a project in a course at Duke University.  The professors realized that the code could be designed better and refactored.  This code base has some code leftover from the original version.
